&pink:VERSE 1:
E               D                 
 Won't you come see about me?

A              D                             
 I'll be alone dancing you know it baby.

E             D                        
 Tell me your troubles and doubts,

A                     D                  
 giving me everything inside and out

E                D                       
 Love's strange, so real in the dark,

A                           D                             
 think of the tender things that we were working on

E                D                    
 Slow change may pull us apart,

A                    D                           
 when the light gets into your heart, baby

D                   D

Rain keeps falling, rain keeps falling

 Don't you  try to pretend,

A                       D                   
 it's my freewill we'll  win in the end.

 vanity and security.

 Going to  take you apart,

A                 D                              
 I'll put us back  together at heart, baby.
