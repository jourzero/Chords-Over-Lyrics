&pink:VERSE 1:

C   Em/B              Am       C/G
 We skipped the light fandango

F       Am/E                     Dm       F/C
 Turned cartwheels is 'cross the floor

G      G/F           Em      G/D
 I was feeling kinda seasick


C        Em/B             Am       C/G
 But the crowd called out for more

F    Am/E             Dm      F/C
 The room was humming harder

G       G/F          Em  G/D
 As the ceiling flew away


C        Em/B           Am            C/G
 When we called out for another drink

F    Am/E             Dm7   Em/G
 The waiter brought a tray


&pink:CHORUS 1:

          C  Em/B     Am    C/G
And so it was    that later

F   Am/E                Dm   F/C
 As the miller told his tale

G     G/F                     Em      G/D
 That her face, at first just ghostly,

         C      F        C   Gsus4(1) G(1)
Turned a whiter shade of pale
 

&pink:INTERLUDE:

F        Am/E    Dm    F/C

&pink:VERSE 2:

C Em/B                  Am     C/G
  She said, There is no reason

F        Am/E              Dm   F/C
 And the truth is plain to see.

G      G/F                 Em           G/D
 But I wandered through my playing cards


C          Em/B        Am  C/G
 And would not let her be

F       Am/E           Dm      F/C
 One of sixteen vestal virgins

G            G/F          Em   G/D
 Who were leaving for the coast


C    Em/B            Am          C/G
 And although my eyes   were open

F           Am/E                      Dm7      Em/G
 They might have just as well've been closed
 

&pink:CHORUS 2:

          C  Em/B     Am    C/G
And so it was    that later

F   Am/E                Dm   F/C
 As the miller told his tale

G         G/F                 Em        G/D
 That her face, at first just ghostly,

         C      F        C/G  Gsus4(1) G(1)
Turned a whiter shade of pale

 As the miller told his tale
