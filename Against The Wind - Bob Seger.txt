VERSE 1:
G          G        
Seems like yesterday

Bm                   Bm 
but it was long ago.  

C                             G                  
Janey was lovely, she was the queen of my nights,

D                              C                 
there in the darkness with the radio playin' low.

G                       G     
And the secrets that we shared

Bm                          Bm 
The mountains that we moved    

C                             G       
Caught like a wildfire out of control,

C                                      
Till there was nothing left to burn and

                D      D 
nothing left to prove.   

BRIDGE:
      Em(2)    D(2)             G  
And I remember what she said to me.

Em(2)                 C(2)        G   
How she swore that it never would end.

Em(2)              D(2)           C     
I remember how she held me, oh so tight.

C                             D                
Wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then.

CHORUS 1:
        G           Bm   
&yellow:Against the wind,

C                           G    
We were running against the wind.

        C(2)      Bm(2)          
We were young and strong, we were

Am(2)   C(2)        G     
running against the wind. 

G      G        G

VERSE 2:
G                            G      
 And the years rolled slowly passed.

Bm                  Bm    
 And I found myself alone.

C                         G                       
Surrounded by strangers I thought were my friends,

D                                C            
Found myself further and further from my home.

      G               G    
And I guess I lost my way. 

Bm                     Bm         
There were oh, so many roads.     

      C                 G               
I was living to run and running to live.

      C                                  D            D
Never worrying about paying, or even how much I owed.  

BRIDGE:
       Em(2)     D(2)                   G    
Moving 8 miles a minute for months at a time,

         Em(2)      C(2)                   G 
Breaking all of the rules that would bend.   


Em(2)      D(2)        C         
I began to find myself searching,

C                     D               
searching for shelter again and again.

CHORUS 2:
         G           Bm    
&yellow: Against the wind. 

       C                 G        
Little somethin' against the wind.

        C(2)   Bm(2)   Am(2)   C(2)        
I found myself seeking shelter against the 

G     G      G  G    
wind. (piano to solo)

BRIDGE:
           Em(2)     D(2)             G   
Well those drifter's days are past me now,

            Em(2)        C(2)  G     
I've got so much more to think about.

Em(2)     D(2) C           
Deadlines and  commitments,

C                 D                 
what to leave in, what to leave out.

CHORUS 3:
        G           Bm   
&yellow:Against the wind.

C                             G     
I'm still running against the wind. 

            C(2)  Bm(2)        
&yellow:I'm older now but still

        Am(2)   C(2)
