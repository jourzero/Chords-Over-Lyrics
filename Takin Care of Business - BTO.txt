&pink:VERSE 1:
    C7                             Bb7                   
You get up every morning from your 'larm clock's warning.

         F7            C7   
Take the 8:15 into the city.

          C7                          Bb7
There's a whistle up above and people pushin' people shovin'

        F7                    C7     
and the girls who try to look pretty.

            C7                       Bb7                
And if your train's on time, you can get to work by nine

               F7                      C7  
and start your slaving job to get your pay.

       C7                        Bb7                  
If you ever get annoyed, look at me, I'm self-employed

  F7                          C7  
I love to work at nothin' all day.

&pink:VERSE 2:
           C7                         Bb7          
If it were easy as fishin', you could be a musician

   F7                            C7    
If you could make sounds loud or mellow

      C7                          Bb7              
Get a second-hand guitar, chances are you'll go far

       F7                             C7     
If you get in with the right bunch of fellows

       C7                         Bb7             
People see you having fun, just a-lying in the sun

F                               C7 
Tell them that you like it this way

         C7                           Bb7               
It's the work that we avoid and we're all self-employed.

   F7                          C7  
We love to work at nothin' all day.
