A              A                   A          A              
Friday night I crashed your party, Saturday I said I'm sorry.

A               A              E      E 
Sunday came and trashed it out again. 

      Bm          Bm          G               G 
I was only having fun, wasn't  hurting anyone 

       E               E             A       A 
and we all enjoyed the weekend for a change. 

&pink:VERSE 2:
          A               A              A                      A         
I've been stranded in the combat zone, I walked through Bedford-Stuy alone

     A            A            E     E 
Even rode my motorcycle in the rain. 

        Bm             Bm     G                  G    
And you told me not to drive, but I made it home alive

       E              E               A       A(NC) 
So you said that only proves that I'm insane. 

&pink:CHORUS 1:
           E      (NC)      A     (NC)
You may be right,  I may be crazy Oh!

               E             D              F#m     A(NC) 
&yellow:But it just may be a lunatic you're looking for

             E       (NC)          A       (NC)
Turn out the lights,  don't try to save me 

                   D               E                          
&yellow:You may be wrong for all I know, but you may be right.

&pink:VERSE 3:
A              A                A                      A    
Remember how I found you there, alone in your electric chair

  A              A               E       E 
I told you dirty jokes until you smiled. 

         Bm           Bm          G            G 
You were lonely for a man, I said take me as I am

           E                E             A      A 
'Cause you might enjoy some madness for a while. 

&pink:VERSE 4:
    A                A                  A               A          
Now think of all the years you tried to find someone to satisfy you

  A           A            E    E 
I might be as crazy as you say.  

       Bm              Bm              G              G   
If I'm crazy then it's true, that it's all because of you 

        E                E         A    A(NC) 
and you wouldn't want me any other way. 

&pink:CHORUS 2:
           E      (NC)      A     (NC)
You may be right,  I may be crazy 

               E             D              F#m     A(NC)

                 E      (NC)              A      (NC)
It's too late to fight,  it's too late to change 

                   D               E                          
&yellow:You may be wrong for all I know, but you may be right.
