Friday night I crashed your party, Saturday I said I'm sorry.

A               A              E      E 
Sunday came and trashed it out again. 

      Bm          Bm          G               G 
I was only having fun, wasn't  hurting anyone

I've been stranded in the combat zone, I walked through Bedford-Stuy alone

     A            A            E     E 
Even rode my motorcycle in the rain. 

        Bm             Bm     G                  G    
And you told me not to drive, but I made it home alive

       E              E               A       A(NC) 
So you said that only proves that I'm insane.

&yellow:But it just may be a lunatic you're looking for

             E       (NC)          A       (NC)
Turn out the lights,  don't try to save me

A              A                A                      A    
Remember how I found you there, alone in your electric chair

  A              A               E       E 
I told you dirty jokes until you smiled. 

         Bm           Bm          G            G 
You were lonely for a man, I said take me as I am

       Bm              Bm              G              G

and you wouldn't want me any other way.

                 E      (NC)              A      (NC)
It's too late to fight,  it's too late to change
