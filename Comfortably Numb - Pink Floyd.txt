&pink:VERSE 1:
Bm                      A                            
Hello, is there anybody in there? Just nod if you can

G(2)    (G/F#) Em(2)      Bm 
hear me.         Is there anyone home? 

Bm                          A                  
Come on, now, I hear you're feeling down, well,

G(2)  (G/F#)    Em(2)                 Bm                 
I can ease your pain, get you on your feet again.

Bm                 A                 
Relax, I need some information first,

G(2)     (G/F#) Em(2)          Bm                     
just the basic  facts. Can you show me where it hurts?

&pink:CHORUS 1:
D                        A        
There is no pain you are receding.

D                             A       
A distant ship's smoke on the horizon,

C                              G     
You are only coming through in waves.

     C                                      G      
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying,

             D                      A     
&yellow:When I was a child I had a fever

           D                        A        
&yellow:My hands felt just like two balloons

        C                              G                      
&yellow:Now I've got that feeling once again, I can't explain,

                      C                            G   
&yellow:you would not understand, this is not how I am.

         A C(2) G(2)               D 
&yellow: I have become comfortably numb.

Bm                  A                            
O.K., just a little pinprick, there'll be no more

G(2)   (G/F#) Em(2)                       Bm                 
Aaaaah!         But you may feel a little sick.

Bm                                  A            
Can you stand up? I do believe it's working good.

                 G(2)  (G/F#)      Em(2)
That'll keep you going through the show,

Bm                     
Come on it's time to go

             D                         A                
&yellow:When I was a child, I caught a fleeting glimpse,

        D                       A   
&yellow:out of the corner of my eye.

        C                           G                           
&yellow:I turned to look but it was gone. I cannot put my finger

        C                                   G              
&yellow:on it now, the child has grown, the dream is gone.

        A C(2) G(2)               D
&yellow:I have become comfortably numb.
