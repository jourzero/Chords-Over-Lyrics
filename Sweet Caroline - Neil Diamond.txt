&pink:VERSE 1:
C         C      
 Where it began, 

F        F
 I can't begin to knowin'

C           C                 
 But then I know it's growing 

G      G
strong

C           C       
 Was in the spring, 

F             F
 and spring became the summer

C             C                   
 Who'd have believed you'd come 

G      G
along.

&pink:BRIDGE:
C       C  
 Hands, 

Am/C            Am/C
 touchin' hands 

G              G   
 Reachin' out, 

F             F    
 Touchin' me, 

         G         G             
Touchin'  you 

&pink:CHORUS 1:
        C          F 
&yellow:(Sweet Caroline)   

F           F               
 good times never seemed so 

G                  G
good  (So Good, So Good, So Good)

C            F                                
 I've been inclined,  

F      F
  to believe they never

G(2)    F(2) Em(2)  Dm(2)
 would  but  now    I... 

&pink:VERSE 2:
C            C
 Look at the night,  

F             F
 And it don't seem so lonely

C           C
 We fill it up with only 

G     G
two.

C           C
 And when I hurt,  

F             F
 Hurtin' runs off my shoulders

C         C
How can I hurt when holding 

G     G
you?

&pink:BRIDGE:
C     C
 Warm, 

Am/C           Am/C
 touchin' warm

G              G
 Reachin' out,  

F             F         
 touchin' me,  touchin'  

G    G
you.

&pink:CHORUS 2:
        C          F 
&yellow:(Sweet Caroline),  

F           F               
 good times never seemed so 

G                       G
good (So Good, So Good, So Good)

C           F
I've been inclined,  

F     F
 to believe they never

G(2)    F(2) Em(2) Dm(2)
 would  Oh,  no,   no.
