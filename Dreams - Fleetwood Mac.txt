&pink:Verse 1:

F              G                 F             G
 Now there you go again, You say you want your freedom.

F            G             F     G
 Well who am I to keep you down?

F          G                     F                G
 It's only right that you should play the way you feel it,

    F             G         F             G
But listen carefully to the sound of your loneliness.


&pink:Pre-Chorus:

       Fmaj7                G7          Fadd9        G7
Like a heartbeat drives you mad, In the stillness of remembering,

             Fmaj7 G7                  Fadd9 G7
What you had,        and what you lost,        and what you had,   

Fmaj7 G7                  Fmaj7    G7
        and what you lost.
 

&pink:Chorus:

     Fmaj7        G7                Fadd9    G7
 Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining.

Fmaj7        G7                    Fadd9    G7
Players only love you when they're playing.

     Fmaj7            G7                 Fadd9  G7
Say, women, they will come and they will go.

Fmaj7           G7             Fadd9        G7
When the rain washes you clean you'll know.    You'll

&pink:Verse 2:

F           G           F               G
 Now here I go again, I see the crystal vision.

F          G          F       G
 I keep my visions to myself.

F         G               F                G
It's only me who wants to wrap around your dreams.

    F            G                    F                G
And have you any dreams you'd like to sell?  Dreams of loneliness.


 &pink:Pre-Chorus:

       Fmaj7                G7          Fadd9        G7
Like a heartbeat drives you mad, In the stillness of remembering,

             Fmaj7 G7                  Fadd9 G7
What you had,        and what you lost,        and what you had,   

Fmaj7 G7                  Fmaj7    G7
        and what you lost.
 

&pink:Chorus:

Fmaj7        G7                Fadd9    G7
Thunder only happens when it's raining.

Fmaj7        G7                    Fadd9    G7
Players only love you when they're playing.

Fmaj7            G7                 Fadd9  G7
Women, they will come and they will go.

Fmaj7           G7             Fadd9  G7
When the rain washes you clean you'll know.

    Fmaj7        G7                Fadd9   G7
Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining.

Fmaj7        G7                    Fadd9    G7
Players only love you when they're playing.     They say  
   
Fmaj7            G7                  Fadd9  G7
"Women they will come  and they will go."

Fmaj7           G7                    Fadd9  G7
When the rain washes you clean you'll know.


&pink:Outro:

       Fmaj7  G7         Fadd9 G7
You'll know.    You will know. Oh, wooah wooah 

       Fmaj7
You'll know. (END)
