VERSE 1:
G                        G(3)                       F(1)
I was a little too tall, coulda' used a few pounds. 

C                    C(3)          F(1) 
Tight pants, points, hardly renown 

G                             G(3)                F(1)
She was a black haired beauty with big dark eyes.

G                        G(3)                        F(1)
Out past the cornfields,  where the woods got heavy. 

C                         C(3)         F(1)
Out in the backseat of my sixty Chevy. 

G                    G(3)               F(1)  
Workin' on mysteries without any clues.

C                               C(3)                 F(1)
  We weren't searching for some pie in the sky summit

G                                   G(3)    F(1)
  We were just young n'restless and bored 

C               C(3)   F(1)
  living by the sword 

G                         G(3)            F(1)
And we'd steal away every chance we could

C                               C(3)         F(1)
To the back room, alley, or the trusty woods

G                           G(3)               F(1)
I used her, she used me but neither one cared, 

C                           C(3)           D(1)

  How far off I sat and wondered

  Started humming a song from 1962

  Ain't it funny how the night moves

C                             Em
